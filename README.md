This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in TypeScript related to early returns within loops. The bug involves using a return statement inside a loop, causing unexpected behavior. The `bug.ts` file contains the buggy code, and `bugSolution.ts` provides the corrected version. The bug is subtle and can be difficult to detect, especially in larger codebases. This example is designed to highlight this error and promote better understanding of loop control flow in TypeScript.
